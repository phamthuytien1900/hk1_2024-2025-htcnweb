        Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success! After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.

    <p>I've started putting up a <a href="../html/Slide1.html">slide show</a> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.
